<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
	Grandma's corn pudding is comfort food at its best. This creamy corn casserole
	is easy to make with both whole kernel and cream-style corn, resulting in a
	custardy pudding that will be a welcome addition to your holiday table. This
	easy corn pudding is a little sweet, a little savory, and totally
	delicious.<br />
	Trust us: There's a reason this old-fashioned side dish has stood the test of
	time. Corn pudding is a creamy side made with stewed corn, butter, and milk.
	It often features a thickening agent, such as cornstarch, to make the dish
	extra decadent. Corn pudding originated in the American South and can be
	served all year long, but it's frequently associated with Thanksgiving.
